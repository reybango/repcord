                    THE REPCORD - a simple bracelet of numbered beads you slide to easily keep
                    accurate track of the reps or rounds without interrupting the flow of the workout.
                    It's right on your wrist - slide a bead and keep working.

            <h1>THE REPCORD</h1>
            <p>
                High intensity training programs are taking over the fitness industry -- do the work as fast as safely possible and do it with a group of people.
                Intense physical work and community support go hand in hand to create an
                intensely addictive physical and emotional feedback loop.
                The intensity of the workouts makes it difficult to keep accurate track of rounds or
                repetitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The RepCord is a simple bracelet you can wear during a workout. You move soft
                silicon, numbered beads to keep track of completed rounds or repetitions. After
                the workout, athletes can wear the bracelet as a subtle reminder that you are part of a team.

            <h1>CHIPS AND CHALK</h1>
            <p>
                Just try to keep track while you rep out front squats with your heart rate at 190.
                Athletes use poker chips or chalk to keep track but they add time to your workout.
                The RepCord is fastened around your wrist. Wear it loose all day and when it's
                time to workout, just tighten it down and move a bead over for each rep or round
                completed -- track progress on your wrist, and you are ready for the next round.

                The patent-pending RepCord is made out of water-resistant 550 military grade
                parachute cord with specially designed beads poured from silicone rubber. We
                numbered the beads to make it easier to know where you stand at a glance.

            <h1>MY BOX RULES</h1>
            <p>
                After the workout the RepCord stays on our wrist as a subtle reminder that we did
                it together. Everyone has one and we all know who we are. If you wear one you
                understand. If you don't understand - don't sweat it - you don't need one.
