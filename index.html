    The RepCord

    CrossFit has inspired lots of high intensity training programs -- do the work as fast 

    as possible and to do it with a group of people. 

    Intense physical work and community support go hand in hand to create an 

    intensely addictive physical and emotional feedback loop. 

    The intensity of the workouts makes it difficult to keep accurate track of rounds or 

    repetitions. 

    The RepCord is a simple bracelet you can wear during a workout. You move soft 

    silicon, numbered beads to keep track of a completed rounds or repetitions. After 

    the workout, athletes can wear the bracelet to as a subtle you are part of a team.

    Just try to keep track while you rep out front squats and with your heart rate at 190. 

    Athletes use poker chips or chalk to keep track but they add time to your workout.

    The RepCord is fastened around your wrist. Wear it loose all day and when its 

    time to workout, just tighten it down and move a bead over for each rep or round 

    completed -- track progress on your wrist, and you are ready for the next round.

    The patent-pending RepCord is made out of water-resistant 550 military grade 

    parachute cord with specially designed beads poured from silicone rubber. We 

    numbered the beads to make it easier to know where you stand at a glance.

    After the workout the RepCord stays on our wrist as a subtle reminder that we did 

    it together. Everyone has one and we all know who we are. If you wear one you 

    understand. If you don't understand - don't sweat it - you don't need one.
